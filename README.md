# TCS

This is a repository of my TCS project in CLR (Common Language Runtime) with SQL.

Working: Only "Manage Students" option is coded as of now.

Not Working: SQL integration on other machines.

I need help in making getting SQL integration on machines other than mine.

I have found out two ways for this:

1. Either I can export my sql database, import it in my program and execute the necessary queries and then export it back again. This is more like file handling.
2. Or I can start an sql server on any machine and then load my database on the localhost server and execute the necessary queries. This makes it easier to code.


In do not know how to do either of these so any help is appreciated.

Install the MOON typeface for correct font.
